# Generate Convex Hull that bounds a TRANSPARENT BACKGROUND image using Monotone chain algorithm

generate convexhull with given maximum vertices, you can change it in main file
this will only work only with transparent background image, any non-transparent background images will lead to a rectangle bounding box
# USEFUL
better collision detection and collision solver
